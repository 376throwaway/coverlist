# coverlist

coverlist is a YouTube music player that lets you create **nested** playlists, great for people who listen to lots of music covers.

### Example
Let's say you want to listen to multiple covers of Bill Wither's,  **Lean On Me**:
| Artist | YouTube URL |
| ------ | ------ |
|Bill Withers (original)|...|
|Glee|...|
|Kirk Franklin|...|
And a ton of covers of **Lost** by Frank Ocean:
| Artist | YouTube URL |
| ------ | ------ |
|Frank Ocean (original)|...|
|Jorja Smith|...|
|Khalid|...|
|MÃ˜|...|

coverlist will help you out: a cover of a song will never play back to back. 
coverlist will pick one **Lean On Me** cover and will pick another random cover of **Lost** upon completion.
