# coverlist

coverlist is a YouTube music player that lets you create **nested** playlists, great for people who listen to lots of music covers.

### Example
Let's say you want to listen to multiple covers of Bill Wither's,  **Lean On Me**:

| Artist | YouTube URL |
| --- | --- |
|Bill Withers (original)|...|
|Glee|...|
|Kirk Franklin|...|

Or a ton of covers of **Lost** by Frank Ocean:

| Artist | YouTube URL |
| --- | --- |
|Frank Ocean (original)|...|
|Jorja Smith|...|
|Khalid|...|
|MÃ˜|...|

coverlist will help you out and a cover of the song never plays back to back. 
coverlist will pick one **Lean On Me** cover and will pick a random cover of **Lost** upon completion.
